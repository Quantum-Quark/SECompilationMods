# SECompilationMods
This is my mega compilation of all 200+ mods I use while simultaneously converting them to use Gens Mats and Components. THIS IS GONNA BE BIG!

For many that look, this is intended for private use to be showcased later. I lead a busy life, and will post the author permissions should I feel that I want to make this publically available. This mod will never work as it sits until such a time that I decide I want this to be available for use. As such, one may try to download and use, but will be met with failure. I am attempting to use all available assests and design the first overhaul for the game, yet so many of our beloved modders are trailing off due to the inefficiency of the update method. The frustrations are endless but the greatest rewards are worth the perserverance.

I am more than open to suggestions for balancing and such. If you know what is going on here and would like to help out, feel free to branch and make a pull request. I will start and finish this, the only variable is the number of people that work on this.

# Tools and Resources
Here I'll post and link all the resources I am using to achieve my goal, some will probably be what you have seen before and others might make you raise an eyebrow. There are some programs that will have alternate programs for, I'm just going to post them all and let you pick and choose what you are going to do. I'm good with logic and reason but my creative half is still in it's infancy so to all that have a better developed creative bone, please pick at me with it and lets make this GRAND!
